# MiniMax
Simulation of a Minimax game in Python by simulating a square board with size m*m filled in with random numbers. The objective of the game is to select one adjacent square (uo, down, left, right) to try to maximize the total score. Once a user cannot move or all  elements in the board are taken, the game ends. The winner will be the player with the highest score.
There are 2 players, each starting at the top left and bottom right corners, respectively.
Player 1 will be the algorithm that will implement the minimax algorithm and the depth parameter is also set by the user, where depth refers to the number of future movements the algorithm will simulate, the bigger, the more sophisticated the movements will be. 

Parameters defined by the user:
* Board size: The board is square, m*m
* Depth of simulation: The number of movements the computer will simulate using the minimax algorithm.
